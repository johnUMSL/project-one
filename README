How to compile the project:
make

Example of how to run the project:
./oss -n 3 -s 2 -t 2

Notes:
- oss launches user processes up to the simultaneous limit, waiting for one to finish before launching the next.
- user prints its PID/PPID, sleeps one second per iteration, then prints again.

Generative AI usage:
Generative AI used: ChatGPT
Prompts:
- "read cs4760Assignment1Spring2026.pdf in local directory and create project according to specifications"
- "Minimal spec: basic oss/user behavior, simple messages, default args, minimal error handling."
Summary: The AI was helpful for quickly drafting the minimal oss/user code structure and Makefile. I reviewed and kept the code concise for the assignment requirements.
